## Prerequisites

Lisk Commander requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as the underlying engine for code execution. Node.js is supported on most operating systems. Follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We currently require Node.js versions 8.3 and above. NPM is automatically installed along with Node.js.

## Installation

### From NPM

```sh
$ npm install --global --production lisk-commander
```

Upon successful completion, NPM will add the `lisk-commander` executable `lisk` to your PATH.

### From Source

Clone the Lisk Commander repository using Git and install the dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-commander.git
$ cd lisk-commander
$ npm install
```

Before running the executable you will need to build Lisk Commander:

```sh
npm run build
```

#### Adding the Lisk Commander executable to your PATH

WARNING: If you have installed Lisk Commander globally via NPM (see [Install Lisk Commander via NPM](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-commander/setup)), following the instructions in this section is not recommended as they will introduce conflicts.

If you would like to add the `lisk` executable to your PATH you have two options: option 1 will install the current state of the code you are installing globally, while option 2 will only link to the code and therefore automatically reflect changes you make going forward.

##### 1. Install globally

Running this command from within the repository will add Lisk Commander to your global NPM packages, and add the `lisk` executable to your PATH. Be aware that any previous globally installed Lisk Commander version will get overridden with this local version.

```sh
$ npm install --global --production
```

Note that you will have to repeat this process for each subsequent build of Lisk Commander.

##### 2. Create a symlink

The other option is to ask NPM to create a symlink in the global folder that links to the package.

```sh
$ npm link
```

This will also add `lisk` to your PATH, but you won't have to repeat the process if you pull or create a new build. Be aware that any previous globally installed Lisk Commander version will get overridden with this local version.
