-- Remove framework-related migration (20180205000000_underscore_patch.sql)
DELETE FROM "migrations" WHERE id = '20180205000000' AND name = 'underscore_patch';

-- Populate `namespace` with correct initial values when exist
UPDATE "migrations" SET namespace = 'network' WHERE id IN ('20161016133824', '20170113181857', '20171207000001', '20171227155620', '20180205000002', '20180327170000', '20181106000006', '20190103000001', '20190111111557');
UPDATE "migrations" SET namespace = 'chain' WHERE namespace = 'undefined';

-- Duplicate 20160723182900_create_schema.sql migration for `network` module if migration exists for `chain` module
-- That is required because 20160723182900_create_schema.sql was splited into two different files (one for each module)
INSERT INTO "migrations" ("id", "name", "namespace")
SELECT '20160723182900', 'create_schema', 'network'
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT * FROM "migrations" WHERE id = '20160723182900' AND name = 'create_schema' AND namespace = 'chain'
