## Disclaimer - Mostly Harmless

Please read our disclaimer carefully. With this repository we have opened access to the alpha release of the Lisk SDK. We have released the Lisk SDK in its current form in order for us to improve the development experience through community feedback and contributions.

We strictly discourage anyone from using the alpha release of the Lisk SDK for any production-based blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a real mainnet. Over the course of the alpha phase there will be significant changes in the Lisk protocol and implementation, which will eventually bring the accessibility and reliability to a level which is feasible for production-based blockchain applications. At this time we only recommend the Lisk SDK for proof-of-concept blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a fake testnet.

The only application built using the Lisk SDK currently feasible for production usage is [Lisk Core](https://github.com/liskhq/lisk-core), the client of the Lisk network itself.

Please be advised we cannot guarantee blockchains created with the alpha release of the Lisk SDK will remain compatible with our planned (beta/rc) releases.

We hope you enjoy building your proof-of-concept blockchain applications using the Lisk SDK, and shall look forward to receiving your feedback and contributions during the alpha phase.

## What is the Lisk SDK

The Lisk SDK aims to provide an easy and reliable software development kit for building blockchain applications which are compatible with the [Lisk Protocol](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-protocol). The architecture of the Lisk SDK has been designed so that it can be extended to meet the requirements of a wide variety of blockchain application use-cases. The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript, which means for a majority of developers, no significant change of tools or mindset is required to get started. The Lisk SDK makes every effort to allow developers to focus simply and purely on writing the code that matters to their own blockchain application, and nothing more.

### Architecture Overview

The Lisk SDK operates on the NodeJS runtime and consists primarily of an application framework (Lisk Framework), a collection of modules providing key application functionalities (Lisk Elements), and a powerful command-line tool which facilitates all aspects of blockchain application development (Lisk Commander). The Lisk SDK has been explicitly designed to shield the complexity of blockchain technology, while exposing an elegant and easy to use interface for developers to build their applications with. An architectural overview of the Lisk SDK is shown below:

## Installation

### Dependencies

Following dependencies need to be installed to run applications created with Lisk SDK:

| Dependencies     | Version |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| NodeJS           | 10.14.3 |
| PostgreSQL       | 10+     |
| Redis (optional) | 5+      |

You can find further details on installing these dependencies on our [documentation guide](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/setup/source#pre-install).

### Installation of Lisk Framework

To start with Lisk SDK you need to install one npm package `lisk-framework`:

```
npm install lisk-framework
```

## Usage

Start from creating a project structure of your blockchain application. No special requirements here, you can create the basic Node.js project folder structure with `npm init`.

Essentially to create a blockchain application, you need to provide an entry point of your application (like `index.js`) and set-up your network by using the modules of Lisk SDK.

It's easy - to have a working blockchain application, mirroring the configuration of Lisk network, it's enough to copy the following three lines of code to your `index.js`:

```js
const { Application, SampleGenesisBlock } = require('lisk-framework');

const app = new Application('my-app', SampleGenesisBlock);

app
	.run()
	.then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
	.catch(error => {
		console.error('Faced error in application', error);
		process.exit(1);
	});
```

After that you can start the application by:

```
node index.js
```

The role model of big-scale application created using Lisk SDK is the client of Lisk network - [Lisk Core](https://github.com/liskhq/lisk-sdk/lisk).

More details on the usage and other configurations along with more samples will become available on Lisk official [documentation portal](http://docs.lisk.io).
