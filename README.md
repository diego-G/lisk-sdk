## Prerequisites

Lisky requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as the underlying engine for code execution. Node.js is supported on most operating systems. Follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You will need version 6.11.x or higher. NPM is automatically installed along with Node.js.

## Installation

### From NPM

```sh
$ npm install --global --production lisky
```

Upon successful completion, NPM will add the `lisky` executable to your PATH.

### From Source

Clone the Lisky repository using Git and install the dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisky.git
$ cd lisky
$ npm install
```
Before running the executable you will need to build Lisky:

```sh
npm run build
```

#### Adding the Lisky executable to your PATH

WARNING: If you have installed Lisky globally via NPM (see [Install Lisky via NPM](docs:lisky-installation-npm)), following the instructions in this section is not recommended as they will introduce conflicts.

If you would like to add the `lisky` executable to your PATH you have two options: option 1 will install the current state of the code you are installing globally, while option 2 will only link to the code and therefore automatically reflect changes you make going forward.

##### 1. Install globally

Running this command from within the repository will add Lisky to your global NPM packages, and add the `lisky` executable to your PATH. Be aware that any previous globally installed lisky version will get overridden with this local version.

```sh
$ npm install --global --production
```

Note that you will have to repeat this process for each subsequent build of Lisky.

##### 2. Create a symlink

The other option is to ask NPM to create a symlink in the global folder that links to the package.

```sh
$ npm link
```

This will also add `lisky` to your PATH, but you won't have to repeat the process if you pull or create a new build. Be aware that any previous globally installed lisky version will get overridden with this local version.

  Commands:

    help [command...]                    Provides help for a given command.
    exit                                 Exits lisky.
    env                                  Print environmental configuration.
    get [options] <type> <input>         Get information from <type> with parameter <input>.
                                         Types available: account, address, block, delegate, transaction
                                         E.g. get delegate lightcurve
                                         e.g. get block 5510510593472232540
    list [options] <type> <variadic...>  Get information from <type> with parameters <input, input, ...>.
                                         Types available: accounts, addresses, blocks, delegates, transactions
                                         E.g. list delegates lightcurve tosch
                                         E.g. list blocks 5510510593472232540 16450842638530591789
    set <variable> <value>               Set configuration <variable> to <value>. Configuration is
                                         persisted in `~/.lisky/config.json`.
lisky>
```

### Non-interactive use

To run commands and options directly from the command line:

```sh
$ lisky get delegate lightcurve --json
```

## Settings

Configuration is stored in a config file placed in the user's home directory (run `help set` to see the exact location). If this is unavailable a default configuration is used. The following settings can be updated (and will be persisted if possible):

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <code>set json true&#124;false</code> | Sets default to JSON output (true) or text output (false) |
| <code>set testnet true&#124;false</code> | Set default to testnet (true) or mainnet (false) |
