## Disclaimer - Mostly Harmless

Please read our disclaimer carefully. We have just opened access to our alpha version of the Lisk SDK and hope to receive detailed feedback. Using our alpha release might still be tedious due to the evolving nature of our work-in-progress code.

We strictly encourage everyone to not use our alpha release for any production blockchain applications. There will be significant changes in the protocol and public interfaces in upcoming releases.

Have fun with our alpha release to build blockchain applications but don't expect to persist your data with future releases of our Lisk SDK. Blockchains created with this release may not be compatible anymore with future releases.

## What is Lisk SDK

Lisk SDK provides an easy, secure and scalable way to create blockchain applications in JavaScript. 

It facilitate developers to create their blockchain ledgers which follow [Lisk Protocol](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-protocol). 

All the tools, IDEs that you are experienced to built backend applications will still applies developing with Lisk SDK.

### Architecture Overview

Lisk SDK is collection of framework, libraries and command line tools to facilitate every aspect for developing a blockchain application. It will hide the complexity of the technology and expose an elegant, easy to use and accessible interfaces for developers. The conceptual stack for the Lisk SDK is shown below:

| [Framework](./framework)   | Responsible for establishing the interactions between blockchain modules (using the Lisk Elemenents libraries) which together with the network configuration are exposed for SDK developers.  |
| [Elements](./elements)     | A collection of libraries, each of them is implementing a single domain of a blockchain element like transactions, cryptography etc. |
| [Commander](./commander)   | A command line tool which helps to manage a node as well as interacting with a network. |

## Installation

### Dependencies

Following dependencies need to be installed to run applications created with Lisk SDK:

| Dependencies     | Version |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| NodeJS           | 10.14.3 |
| PostgreSQL       | 10+     |
| Redis (optional) | 5+      |

You can find further details on installing these dependencies on our [documentation guide](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/setup/source#pre-install).

### Installation of Lisk SDK

To start with Lisk SDK you need to install one npm package - `lisk-framework`:

```
npm install lisk-framework
```

## Usage

The development flow is standard as you do with any NodeJS backend application. Here are few steps to get started.

```bash
mkdir my_app
cd my_app
npm init
npm install --save lisk-framework
```

At this point you will have an entry file in the directory called `index.js`. You can copy past following code in that file to start with.

```js
const { Application, SampleGenesisBlock } = require('lisk-framework');

const errorHandler = error => {
	console.error('Faced error in application', error);
	process.exit(1);
};

try {
	const app = new Application('my-app', SampleGenesisBlock);

	app
		.run()
		.then(() => app.logger.info(' App started...'))
		.catch(errorHandler);
} catch (error) {
	errorHandler(error);
}
```

After that you can start the application by:

```
node index.js
```

For more details on application and other configurations along with more samples please visit Lisk official [documentation portal](http://docs.lisk.io).
