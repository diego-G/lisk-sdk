## Disclaimer - Mostly Harmless

Please read our disclaimer carefully. We have just opened access to our alpha version of the Lisk SDK and hope to receive detailed feedback. Using our alpha release might still be tedious due to the evolving nature of our work-in-progress code.

We strictly encourage everyone to not use our alpha release for any production blockchain applications. There will be significant changes in the protocol and public interfaces in upcoming releases.

Have fun with our alpha release to build blockchain applications but don't expect to persist your data with future releases of our Lisk SDK. Blockchains created with this release may not be compatible anymore with future releases.

## What is Lisk SDK

Lisk SDK provides an easy, secure and scalable way to create blockchain applications in JavaScript. 

It facilitate developers to create their blockchain ledgers which follow [Lisk Protocol](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-protocol). 

All the tools, IDEs that you are experienced to built backend applications will still applies developing with Lisk SDK.

### Architecture Overview

Lisk SDK is consists of a framework, libraries and command line tools to facilitate all the aspects of developing a blockchain application. It hides the complexity of the technology and exposes an elegant, easy to use and accessible interfaces for developers. The conceptual stack for the Lisk SDK is shown below:

| [Framework](./framework)   | Responsible for establishing the interactions between blockchain modules (using the Lisk Elemenents libraries) which together with the network configuration are exposed for SDK developers.  |
| [Elements](./elements)     | A collection of libraries, each of them is implementing a single domain of a blockchain element like transactions, cryptography etc. |
| [Commander](./commander)   | A command line tool which helps to manage a node as well as interacting with a network. |

## Installation

### Dependencies

Following dependencies need to be installed to run applications created with Lisk SDK:

| Dependencies     | Version |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| NodeJS           | 10.14.3 |
| PostgreSQL       | 10+     |
| Redis (optional) | 5+      |

You can find further details on installing these dependencies on our [documentation guide](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/setup/source#pre-install).

### Installation of Lisk SDK

To start with Lisk SDK you need to install one npm package - `lisk-framework`:

```
npm install lisk-framework
```

## Usage

Start from creating a project structure of your blockchain application. No special requirements here, you can create the basic Node.js project folder structure with `npm init`. 

Essentially to create a blockchain application, you need to provide an entry file of your application (like `app.js`) and set-up your network by using the modules of Lisk SDK. 

It's easy - to have a working blockchain application, mirroring the configuration of Lisk network,  it's enough to copy the following three lines of code to your `app.js`:


```js
const { Application, SampleGenesisBlock } = require('lisk-framework');

const app = new Application('my-app', SampleGenesisBlock);

app
	.run()
	.then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
	.catch(error => {
			console.error('Faced error in application', error);
			process.exit(1);
		   });
```

After that you can start the application by:

```
node app.js
```

For more details on application and other configurations along with more samples please visit Lisk official [documentation portal](http://docs.lisk.io).

The role model of big-scale application created using Lisk SDK is the client of Lisk network - [Lisk Core](https://github.com/liskhq/lisk-core).
