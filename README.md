# Lisk JS

Lisk JS is a JavaScript library for sending Lisk transactions. It's main benefit is that it does not require a locally installed Lisk node, and instead utilizes the existing peers on the network. It can be used from the client as a [browserify](http://browserify.org/) compiled module, or on the server as a standard Node.js module.
